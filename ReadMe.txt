The problem will give you an opportunity to understand and implement two distributed
mutual exclusion(DME) algorithms namely Lamport’s DME and Singhal’s DME. The
problem is about the implementation of a Fastest Finger First (FFF) game of Kaun
Banega Crorpati (KBC) serial, which is currently running on Sony TV. The game runs
on eleven machines and one of these machines acts as a server known as ‘Amitabh’ and
the other ten machines are the ‘Participants’. All the machines communicate with each
other by passing messages through sockets. The implementations of the ‘Server’ and
‘Participant’ applications for both these algorithms are described in the following two
sections.
